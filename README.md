# SASS BASE

**My Source of Truth**

Based off [Modular Design](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_design) â€“ with [SMACSS](http://smacss.com/) at its core. It incorporates other open-source projects including Animate.css and Materalize.css which are maintained via BowerJS. A GruntJS configuration has also been implemented and provides common build processes including SASS, Compass, Compile, CSSMin, HTMLHint, Concatenation, Uglify, Watch and more.

## Getting Started

#### Step 1: Install Dependencies
1. [node](http://nodejs.org/): follow the link and click the button
2. [ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/installation/): this comes pre-installed on macs
3. `gem install sass` & `gem install compass`
4. `npm install grunt` & `npm install grunt-cli`: installs grunt and grunt-cli globally.
5. `npm install -g bower` : installs bower globally (*optional*)

**Note:**

 - Depending on your permissions setup, you might need to prefix each command with `sudo` (use with caution)
 - All user level installs: `cd ~` will put you at your user level


#### Step 2: Clone Project

You'll need to clone this repository so that its on your local computer.

```
$ cd /path/to/your/repo
$ git clone git@github.com:nauerster/sass-base.git

```

#### Step 3: Know Your Git Commads
* `git add -A`: stages all files to commit (locally)
* `git commit -am "Commit message"`: commits all files with a description
* `git push origin {branch name}`: push committed files to repository
* `git branch {new branch}`: creates a new working branch
* `git checkout branch`: switches you to your new branch
* `git merge {branch name}` : will merge changes from the specified branch into your current branch

## Fire It Up
Follow these instructions to fire up your `Sass Plate` after ensuring you have all dependencies listed above installed in your environment.

1. In Terminal/Command-line, navigate to the root directory (where Gruntfile.js is located)
  * Install Node Modules: `npm install`

2. In the same directory run the following command
  * `grunt serve`: css file will be output into the dev folder. The watch task will continue to run until you quit it `(ctrl + c)`.
  * `grunt build`: will run all the same dev tasks, but will compress our css file for final release.


## Documentation
Using [SassDoc](http://http://sassdoc.com/), you can parse your source folder to grab documentation-specific comments. From there, it builds a data tree, that gets enhanced and filtered before being passed to the view.

1. In Terminal/Command-line, simply run 'grunt sassdoc' at the root of your project directory.




## File Organization
